    General Rules

2) Follow Discord TOS Please Follow the rules of Discord and the Discord TOS. This server will not go against Discord's TOS. This server will not break any rules that Discord has nor promote anyone in breaking the rules of Discord. https://discord.com/guidelines.

3) Please refrain from NSFW Posting/having direct NSFW/sexual/edgy/abusive/pornographic/gore/nazi/ posts/pfp's and will result in a warning (or ban, in a series of warnings). This is a PG-13 server, so keep it tasteful. If it's consentual, take it to DM's.

4) No tolerance for discrimination of harassment Engaging in racial slurs/hate speech/insults against minorities, cultures, regions, races, ethnicities, genders, groups or individuals in any text/content is banned. Same applies for members who promote rape/sexual assault/nazism/child abuse/incest/acts of terror or violence. Insulting male/female jokes is banned.

5) Respect personal beliefs Religion bashing will result in a warning. You can discuss religious beliefs but do not insult them, critically and constructively analysing them is fine as long as it promotes healthy discussions. Political discussions authorized. However, Statizens discuss respectfully and with an open mind. Hateful commentary and bashing will result in a ban.

Behavior Rules
6)  Foster a healthy environment Creating a toxic/unhealthy environment for others by spamming (same image or statement), bullying, insulting users or trolling/bashing/posting content that starts toxic arguments/fights/drama will result in a warning or ban. Please refrain from intimate conversations, e-dating, and doing things that generally make people feel uncomfortable in public chats. If asked to stop by a moderator, comply. Take it to DMâ€™s

7) No spamming All sorts of spamming via text/memes/posts/videos/emojis in the server along with VC spamming/screaming/hurling of insults and in the DMs of any fellow server member is banned.

8) No Instigation Slandering, gossiping, scandalising users/servers and posting server links in raid groups is not allowed along with starting drama between servers. If found doing so, you may be banned. No sharing screenshots of profiles or chats in other servers/dms. No advertising other servers that aren't formally affiliated with Statville.

Content Sharing Rules
9) Statizens will not post material that is sensitive in nature, including illegal content, pirated software, copyright materials and classified documents. 

10) Give Credit where credit is due, cite your sources if producing a reference.

Moderation Overview
11) Due to recent events, moderators will be censoring certain words, controversial figures/events. Just trust us and don't worry if a word you said gets deleted by the bot.

12) The moderation team aims to make decisions based on context and severity. That means, the moderation team might choose to warn a user for one offense but ban another for the same infraction due to their moderation history. Generally, 3 warnings = ban.

13) Leadership responsibilities Administrators and moderators will present a united front in public, while disagreements may occur behind closed doors. Individuals within the server deserve attentive administration, thus lack of service will result in removal from the team.

14) Geopositioning/Geolocating
Geopositioning or geolocating is explicitly prohibited. Geolocating is the process or technique of identifying the exact geographical location of a person or device by means of digital imagery processed via the internet. This can be in the exact geographical coordinates. You are allowed to use pictures of locations or landmarks. An example may be but is not limited to the Eiffel Tower, Disney World or the Hollywood sign.

If you believe the behavior or action of a member of the moderation team is unjust, please see the below on how to receive assistance.
